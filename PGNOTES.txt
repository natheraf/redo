In the terminal, type the following to start local postgres server: (not to self)
```
brew services start postgresql@16
```
After starting the server, you can connect to the database using the following command:
```
psql postgres
```
Then you can use pgAdmin to connect to the database, and view the tables and data.

To stop the server, type the following in the terminal:
```
brew services stop postgresql@16
```

NOTE: If you are using a different version of postgres, replace `16` with your version number.
